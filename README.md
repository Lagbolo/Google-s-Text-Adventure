# Google Text Adventure

## Computer programming 11 solo final project.

Back in middle school, I used to search "text adventure", ctrl+shift+i, and go to the console to play Google's easter egg text adventure game during class.
The game has always been a fond memory for me, so when I was asked to code something for my final project in my Python class in summer school a few years ago, I decided to recreate this game from scratch.
